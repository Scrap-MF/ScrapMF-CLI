//! Saved content batches: a name, the accounts to run it on, and what each one

//! A task answers *what and for whom*; a profile answers *how*, with per-run
//! content choices and per-site overrides. They are separate on purpose —
//! separate directory, struct, menus and flows — but both speak
//! [`config::Account`], so a cookie session behaves the same in each.
//!
//! Content belongs to the account, not the task: the wizard asks site → account
//! → content per account, so two instagram accounts in one task can want
//! different things. A task may span networks, and the kinds are a *filter*
//! rather than an instruction — each account is validated against what its site
//! actually supports, and one that cannot serve the request is named and
//! skipped instead of silently fetching something else.
